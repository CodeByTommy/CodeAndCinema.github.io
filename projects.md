  My projects blend AI, IoT, and cinematic storytelling, bridging technology and creativity to develop intelligent systems and immersive narratives. From AI-driven automation and assistive technology to film editing and visual storytelling, my work is driven by precision, innovation, and human-centered design. By integrating engineering with storytelling, I strive to create solutions that enhance lives, evoke emotions, and push the boundaries of both technology and art. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¬
