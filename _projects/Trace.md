  **Trace (Cinematic Storytelling Project)**
  
  Role: Editor & Script Supervisor  
  
  Specialization: Film Editing, Narrative Structure, Continuity Management
  
  *Project Overview:*
  Memory is fleeting, fragile—fading like the flickering glow of an old cinema reel. Trace is a poignant exploration of memory, loss, and the passage of time, unraveling the delicate fabric of remembrance through the eyes of Ah Hock, an elderly man clinging to a promise, waiting for someone who may never arrive.

  As reality and recollection intertwine, Trace captures the quiet ache of forgetting and the weight of remembering. It is a study of how cinema preserves moments, freezing time even as it slips through our fingers.

  As the Editor and Script Supervisor, my role was to sculpt emotion from raw footage, shaping the film’s pacing, rhythm, and visual cadence to reflect the ebb and flow of memory itself. I ensured that every cut, every transition, and every lingering shot felt like a heartbeat echoing through time.
