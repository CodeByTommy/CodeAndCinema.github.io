Hi, I’m Tommy Ang, a Computer Engineer with a passion for storytelling.  
My work blends the precision of software development with the emotional depth of film,  
exploring how technology and narrative intersect.  

Whether it’s building automation solutions, developing computer vision models,  
or crafting cinematic experiences, I strive to create work that is both functional and evocative.  
Welcome to my space, where engineering meets creativity.

<!-- For my personal site I've toned it down a bit. Instead of a flashy sidebar image, I chose a solid background color.
However, I've given [certain](https://qwtel.com/projects/ducky-hunting/) [pages](https://qwtel.com/projects/blocky-blocks/) big sidebar images, and let Hydejack blend back to normal when the user navigates away.

While I love the font used for Hydejack's headings, for my personal site I felt less of a need to control the typesetting.
That's why I'm not using Google Fonts, and instead use whatever is the default for the reader's operating system.

```yml
google_fonts: false
font:         false
font_heading: false
font_code:    false
```

The configuration I use to enable the system font on my site. Feel free to copy!
