CodeLimb: Intelligent Prosthetics for a Connected Future

CodeLimb is an innovative bionic arm system that bridges artificial intelligence, IoT, and embedded engineering to create an affordable, modular prosthetic solution. This project leverages non-invasive motion tracking, real-time data processing, and adaptive control mechanisms to replicate natural limb movements with precision.

Designed with modularity and accessibility in mind, the system features a wearable IoT glove equipped with sensors that detect motion from the user’s existing limb, transmitting data wirelessly to a STM32-based control unit. This ensures low-latency, real-time adaptation, with a response time of 0.1 to 0.3 seconds and motion accuracy of 80%.

Incorporating machine learning-driven gesture recognition, CodeLimb explores the potential of AI-enhanced prosthetics—allowing intuitive responses to predefined gestures like clapping, walking, and object manipulation. With 3D-printed components, the design is scalable and cost-effective, making it possible to produce and customize the prosthetic anywhere in the world.

By addressing the limitations of current prosthetic solutions—such as high cost, limited adaptability, and lack of real-time responsiveness—CodeLimb is a significant step toward democratizing assistive technology. Future iterations will focus on strength testing, improved sensitivity, and advanced AI integration, further refining its role in enhancing mobility and improving the quality of life for individuals with limb impairments.


<!-- For my personal site I've toned it down a bit. Instead of a flashy sidebar image, I chose a solid background color.
However, I've given [certain](https://qwtel.com/projects/ducky-hunting/) [pages](https://qwtel.com/projects/blocky-blocks/) big sidebar images, and let Hydejack blend back to normal when the user navigates away.

While I love the font used for Hydejack's headings, for my personal site I felt less of a need to control the typesetting.
That's why I'm not using Google Fonts, and instead use whatever is the default for the reader's operating system.

```yml
google_fonts: false
font:         false
font_heading: false
font_code:    false
```

The configuration I use to enable the system font on my site. Feel free to copy!
